Notice me senpai is a program that lets you take a window and float it over all others on your desktop. This lets you turn any window in the a piture and piture.

There are other features like changing the opacity`, size`, and more. Make sure you take a look at the HOTKEYS tab before closeing this window. 

once you have looked over the hotkeys it will live in your system tray.

I wrote this with autohotkeys so if you want to modify it to what you need you can download the AHK script file and change what you want and compile with there compiler.
